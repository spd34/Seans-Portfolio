<H1> Sean's Portfolio</H1>
<h2>Decription</h2>
<p> Build a portfolio page, which you can add to as the course progresses. A portfolio of work can showcase my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights my strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. Having  portfolios with deployed web applications (meaning they are live on the web) are typically very successful in their career search after the boot camp. This last point canâ€™t be stressed enough: having several deployed projects is a minimum requirement to receive an initial interview at many companies.
 This Challenge will set myself up for future success by applying the core skills you've recently learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. Practice my new skills while creating something that I will use during my job search. <p>
